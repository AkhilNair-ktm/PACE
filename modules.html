            What is the PACE Satellite?
          </h2>
          <div class="cont1 mt-5">
            <p>
              The PACE satellite is like a special robot that flies high up in
              space, looking down at Earth. It helps scientists learn more about
              our oceans, the air, and the clouds!
            </p>

          <img src="asset/image/PACE.jpg" alt="" />
          <h2 class="text-blue-600 font-bold">•What Does It Do?</h2>
          <div class="cont1">
            <p>
              1. Looks at the Ocean: The PACE satellite can see tiny plants
              called phytoplankton in the ocean. These little plants are super
              important because they help make oxygen, just like trees do on
              land! They are food for many sea animals too. <br />
              <br />2. Watches the Air: The satellite can also check the air
              around us to see how clean it is. It looks for tiny bits called
              aerosols that can come from things like dust, smoke, and
              pollution. This helps us know if the air is healthy to breathe.<br />
              <br />
              3. Studies the Clouds: PACE watches the clouds to learn more about
              the weather. It helps scientists understand how clouds can affect
              the Earth’s temperature and climate.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-blue-600 font-bold">•What is Its Purpose?</h2>
            <p>
              The main purpose of the PACE satellite is to help scientists
              understand how our planet works. By looking at the ocean, air, and
              clouds, scientists can learn about how healthy our oceans are, how
              clean our air is and how weather and climate change over time
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-blue-600 font-bold">• Why is This Important?</h2>
            <p>
              Protecting Nature: By learning about the oceans and air, we can
              better protect them. Healthy oceans and clean air are important
              for all living things, including humans, animals, and plants.
              Fighting Climate Change: The information from PACE helps
              scientists figure out how climate change is affecting our planet.
              This way, they can help make plans to keep the Earth safe and
              healthy for the future.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-blue-600 font-bold">• In Summary</h2>
            <p>
              The PACE satellite is like a super spy in space, helping us learn
              about our oceans, air, and clouds so we can take better care of
              our planet!

            Introduction to Light-01
          </h1>
          <div class="cont1 mt-5">
            <p>
              Light is what helps us see everything around us! Without light,
              our world would be completely dark. But did you know that light is
              really special: Scientists are still figuring out all the details,
              but we’ve gotten very good at describing what light does. For
              example, light travels super-fast at 671 million miles per hour!
              Or 3,00,000 kms per seconds. Nothing can go faster than light. We
              will explore these sections in this module:
              <br />
              <br />
              1. Section I - What is light, and why is it important?
              <br /><br />
              2. Section II - How does light make the colors we see?
              <br /><br />
              3. Section III - How does light interact with things in the air
              like clouds and aerosols? <br /><br />
              4. Section IV - How does light interact with things in the ocean?

            <p>
              Light is a kind of energy that helps us see things! It travels in
              waves and can also be thought of as tiny particles called photons.
              And why is it important? Light is important because it helps us
              see the world around us, allows plants to grow by making food from
              sunlight and keeps us healthy. Excited to know more? We do have a
              quick for the video.

              That was fast!! Now do you know about transmission? It is when
              light passes through something. Imagine light as a traveler on a
              road. When it comes to something clear like glass or water, it can
              go straight through without stopping! That’s why you can see
              through windows or a glass of water—because the light travels
              through them easily and reaches your eyes. How about reflection?
              Reflection is when light bounces off something. Think of light as
              a ball you throw at a wall. When it hits the wall, it bounces back
              to you! This is what happens when light hits a mirror or a shiny
              surface. The light bounces off, and that’s how you can see
              yourself in a mirror! And refraction, Refraction is when light
              bends as it passes through something. Imagine you're pushing a toy
              car from a smooth floor onto a carpet. The car slows down and
              changes direction a bit when it hits the carpet. Light does the
              same thing when it moves from air into water or glass—it bends!
              This is why a straw in a glass of water looks like it's broken or
              bent—it’s because the light is bending as it passes through the
              water. Want to know more? Take a small detour and explore the
              world of light wonders.
            </p>

            <p>
              Scattering is when light spreads out in different directions.
              Imagine you throw a handful of sand into the air, and the grains
              go everywhere! Light does something similar when it hits tiny
              things like dust or water droplets in the air. Instead of going
              straight, it spreads in all directions. This is why the sky looks
              blue during the day—the sunlight gets scattered by the air, and
              the blue color spreads out across the sky! You might be wondering
              if you could actually see it, isn’t it? Take this quick video and
              enjoy yourself

              This spectrum of energy, or spectrum of light, is referred to as
              the Electromagnetic Spectrum. NASA explores the properties of
              different wavelength regions in the electromagnetic spectrum
              ranging from radio waves to gamma rays. Right around the middle of
              the spectrum we have visible light - the rainbow of colors we know
              and love. Just shorter than visible light are the ultraviolet
              wavelengths, which we wear sunscreen to protect ourselves from.
              Just longer than visible light is infrared, which we sense as
              warmth on our skin.

              Let's look closer at the visible light portion of the spectrum.
              Blue light is more energetic than red light; i.e., it has a
              shorter wavelength than red light. Specifically, we can say that
              blue light wavelengths are between 450-490 nanometers (nm) long
              whereas red light is 620-750 nm long. One nanometer is the
              equivalent of 0.000000001 meters. When discussing how light
              interacts with the ocean and atmosphere, we often refer to
              wavelengths in terms of nm.

              • How does light make the colours we see?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Imagine that light is like a rainbow of colors shining down on
              everything around us. When light hits an object, like a banana,
              some colors are absorbed, and some colors are bounced back. Think
              of a banana as a sponge that soaks up almost all the colors from
              the rainbow but lets the yellow color bounce back to our eyes.
              That's why when you look at a banana, it looks yellow! So, when
              you see a yellow banana, you’re seeing the color that it reflects
              while the other colors are being soaked up. It's like the banana
              is playing hide-and-seek with the colors! Colors come from light,
              and different colors are like different heights of waves in the
              ocean. When we look at something, it reflects some of those waves
              back to our eyes, which helps us see its color. Scientists have a
              special tool called a spectrometer. This tool helps them see which
              colors, or wavelengths, of light are bouncing off objects. For
              example, a green banana peel reflects a lot of light around the
              color green (about 550 nanometers), while a ripe yellow banana
              reflects light in the red area (about 675 nanometers). Every
              object has a special pattern, like a fingerprint, called a
              spectral signature. This signature tells scientists exactly what
              colors the object reflects. So, if scientists know the
              fingerprints of things in the ocean, like tiny plants called
              phytoplankton or mud, they can tell what’s in the water by looking
              at the light that PACE's spectrometer sees. It’s like a treasure
              map for finding out what’s in the ocean!

              all around the earth. Phytoplankton convert sunlight into energy
              through photosynthesis. This energy goes up the food chain as
              phytoplankton are eaten by small animals. Then bigger animals eat
              those small animals. So, phytoplankton are like the first step in

              The role of aerosols in climate science is complex. In general,
              light-colored particles in the atmosphere will reflect incoming
              sunlight and cause cooling. Dark-colored particles absorb sunlight
              and make the atmosphere warmer. Feel free to explore more using

              Clouds are super important for life on Earth! They can tell us a
              lot about the weather and climate. Some clouds help keep us cool
              by blocking the sun, while others trap heat, making Earth warmer.
              Scientists want to understand how clouds affect Earth's
              temperature and help keep the environment in balance.

            How Does the PACE Satellite Study Clouds?

            <p>
              The PACE satellite is like a detective in space, using special
              tools to watch clouds from above. Here’s what it does: <br />
              1. Watching from Space: PACE looks down at Earth and takes
              pictures of clouds to see how big they are, where they are, and
              how they change over time. <br />
              2. Looking Inside Clouds: PACE can tell what clouds are made
              of—tiny water droplets or ice crystals—by using light. It studies
              how clouds reflect sunlight back into space. <br />
              3. Why It’s Cool: By studying clouds, PACE helps us understand how
              weather changes, how much sunlight Earth gets, and even how much
              rain or snow we might get. It’s like having a giant weather
              station in space!

            <p>
              The PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) mission
              launched on 8 February 2024 and completed commissioning on 5 April
              2024. PACE has released its first science data from three
              instruments: OCI, HARP2, and SPEXone, with updates planned. The
              data is organized into five levels, ranging from raw data
              (Level-1A) to detailed global maps (Level-4), focusing on ocean
              color and atmospheric properties. The data is provided in small
              chunks called granules—5-minute segments for OCI and HARP2, and
              50-minute segments for SPEXone. While there are some issues, such
              as location errors and reduced accuracy in certain areas, this
              initial release is an important step toward better understanding
              Earth’s oceans and atmosphere.
